An access token is an object that describes the security context of a process or thread. The information in a token includes the identity and privileges of the user account associated with the process or thread. When a user logs on, the system verifies the user's password by comparing it with information stored in a security database. If the password is authenticated, the system produces an access token. Every process executed on behalf of this user has a copy of this access token.

The system uses an access token to identify the user when a thread interacts with a securable object or tries to perform a system task that requires privileges. Access tokens contain the following information:

The security identifier (SID) for the user's account
SIDs for the groups of which the user is a member
A logon SID that identifies the current logon session
A list of the privileges held by either the user or the user's groups
An owner SID
The SID for the primary group
The default DACL that the system uses when the user creates a securable object without specifying a security descriptor
The source of the access token
Whether the token is a primary or impersonation token
An optional list of restricting SIDs
Current impersonation levels
Other statistics
