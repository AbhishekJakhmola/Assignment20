A library contains re-usable chunks of code (a software program).
These re-usable codes of library is linked to your program through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). That is, API is interface to library through which re-usable codes are linked to an application program.
In simple term it can be said that an API is an interface between two software programs which facilitates the interaction between them.

For example, in procedural languages like C, the library math.c contains the implementations of mathematical function, such as sqrt, exp, log etc. It contains the definition of all these functions.
These function can be referenced by using the API math.h which describes and prescribes the expected behavior.


API is a part of library which defines how an application communicates with external code.
API can be written in any language.
Library is written in same language which is a collection of all the functionalities required for the use case.
For example : Numpy is a library of Python, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
